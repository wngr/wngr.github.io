# About

Hi! My name is Oliver. I'm a Software Engineer interested in distributed systems
and decentralization, both technically and philosophically.

Currently I work at [Actyx](https://www.actyx.com/), where we build a
decentralized edge platform for factories. At its core this provides a peer to
peer and gossip based resilient event store and dissemination system built in
Rust.

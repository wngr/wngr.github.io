# About

I'm Oliver. I'm a Software Engineer interested in distributed systems and
decentralization, both technologically and philosophically.

Currently I work at [Helsing](https://helsing.ai/), where I work on
distributed systems in challenging and unforgiving environments.

Before that I worked at [Actyx](https://www.actyx.com/), where we
[built](https://github.com/Actyx/Actyx) a decentralized edge platform for
factories. At its core this provides a peer to peer and gossip based resilient
event store and dissemination system built in Rust.

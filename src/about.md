# About

I'm Oliver, a Software Engineer interested in distributed systems and
decentralization, both technologically and philosophically.

Currently I work on a peer-to-peer networking stack for extremely constrained
and unforgiving environments at [Helsing](https://helsing.ai/).

Before that I worked at [Actyx](https://www.actyx.com/), where we
[built](https://github.com/Actyx/Actyx) a decentralized edge platform for
factories, centered around a peer-to-peer and gossip-based resilient event
store.

And even earlier, I dabbled with safety-critical systems in factory automation
(I once was a Mechanical Engineer!).
This diverse background built my commitment to creating software that runs
reliably in the toughest conditions. Better sleep safe and sound :-).

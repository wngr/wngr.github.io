# Hello, World!

Welcome to my little corner of the web. Maybe some bits of information found on this website are useful and/or
entertaining to somebody, at least they will hopefully be for future-me.

If you want to reach out, you can find my e-mail address in my [Github profile](https://github.com/wngr).


### What's this weird setup?

I created this website using the awesome [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) tool by the
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) team, which is yet another static website generator. Using its standard
configuration, this yields a content-focused view with a clear layout. Additional, there are some neat features like
including runnable code snippets.
